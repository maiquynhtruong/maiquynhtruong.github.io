## Software Intern at [Swisslog](https://www.swisslog.com/en-us)
### May 2017 - December 2017

At Swisslog, I developed software running on warehouse agents for the solutions. More specifically, I helped write internal XML messages passed between host server and Swisslog controls software. I also wrote unit tests for the system.

## Software Intern at [Atomic Robot](https://atomicrobot.com/)
### May 2018 - August 2018
### Mason, OH

At Atomic Robot, I developed Android mobile applications in Kotlin. One of my projects was for a pilot training business. My team and I did a UI overhaul for the app. I collaborated with designers to implement mockups into code.

Besides making Android app, I also wrote technical blog posts about Google products. I did two posts on Actions on Google.
