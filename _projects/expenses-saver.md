### Overview
- Tally count the number of times you have purchased and total amount of money you have spent on an item (Starbucks, Fries, etc)
- You can review the counters after some time and realize if 'but it costs only a few bucks...' really sums up to something.

### Structure of project
- The list of tallies is backed by two maps: a map to store the tally names and a map to store other attributes.
- A tally has three attributes: amount, value, step (how much each item costs).
- Upon purchasing an item, click on the plus sign to increment the count.
