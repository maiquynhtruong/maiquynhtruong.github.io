<h2>About</h2>
<p>Nice to meet you!<br>
 My name is Mai, and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors degree. 
I have some interests in building Android mobile applications and web applications
I spend most of my free time outside of school on my side projects that can be found at my <a href="https://www.github.com/maiquynhtruong">Github</a>.</p>
<p>solving programming problems mostly on <a href="http://codeforces.com">Codeforces</a> and other sites. I sometimes blog about some problems that are interesting to me <a href="/Blog/index.html">here</a>.</p>
