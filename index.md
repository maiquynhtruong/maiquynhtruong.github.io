Hello, nice to meet you! Welcome to my little corner on the Wild Web!

I am Mai, and I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati, in Cincinnati, Ohio. I will be graduating in Spring 2019.

My interests are Android application development and compiler design. Outside of school, I spend most of my time on side projects that are hosted on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/maiquynhtruong). I sometimes solve solving programming problems Leetcode, Codeforces and similar sites. I also write [blog](/blog) about technical problems that I find interesting.
